Here you will find all the scripts i use to manage and interrogate Azure.
You will notice in some of the scripts, hashes '#####' replace some of the code. This is sensitive information and should be replaced with your own. For information on using the scripts please see comments on individual files. I am working on converting all sctipts to cmdlets, for ease of use.
